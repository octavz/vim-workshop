To run with the webpack development server run `npm run server` and view in the browser at htp://localhost:8000. 
Running in this environment provides hot reloading and support for routing; just edit and save the file and the browser will automatically refresh.

To use a port other than 8000 set the `PORT` environment variable (`PORT=8080 npm run server`).
